                <p><strong>Who is this girl!?</strong></p>
                <p>I first saw her on the first day of college.  
                She is incredibly beautiful, not in the usual sense, but there was something about her that made me feel a sense of affection that day. After that, I couldn't find her anywhere in college, no matter how much I searched or asked, I couldn't get any information.</p>

                <p>Then, one day, I, the bunking student, was attending a class, and I saw that same stunning girl—though not the exact same, she was still enchanting.  
                I saw her in a Commerce class, and I was there too because I had changed my group when I joined college.</p>
                <p>Anyway, seeing her, I thought maybe now I should take on a new challenge. I thought about staying in this group, even though I didn’t know anything about Commerce. I was ready to take on the risky task. Just then, I found out that she had, like me, changed her group to join the college, and now she was going to the Humanities group.</p>
                <p>What a coincidence! I had wanted to join the Humanities group as well.</p>

                <p>I started gathering information about you slowly, trying to become your friend, and now I am your friend. But to become this friend, I had to go through a lot, like becoming friends with your college friends first, giving my friends favors to collect your social media accounts, going to private coaching despite having a severe fever (you were also studying at the same private coaching), and so much more.</p>

                <p>Anyway, eventually, we got to know each other well. Then, suddenly, I did something wrong, which I'll tell you if you ever ask. Now, let me get to the point. Since you’re reading this, you must know it's for you. I don’t know how or what happened, but I have so many things in my heart that I don’t know if I can express them to you.</p>
                <p>However, let me say one thing: I want a gift from you on your birthday as a return gift, and that gift is you yourself.</p>
                <p><strong>Let me be clear, will you be mine forever? Can I take you for forever?</strong></p>
